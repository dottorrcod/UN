## What Is Dordle?

At first glance, **Dordle** might seem like a playful parody of Wordle, but itâ€™s much more than that. As its tagline suggests, Dordle is "Wordle plus Wordle." Instead of solving just one word puzzle, players face the challenge of deciphering two 5-letter mystery words simultaneously. You get **seven guesses** to crack both grids, with each guess applying to both puzzles.

Every input you make is reflected on both grids, and the feedback received helps you deduce the hidden words. This unique setup tests not only your vocabulary but also your deductive reasoning skills.

## Dordle vs. Wordle: What Sets Them Apart?

While Dordle and Wordle share several similarities, Dordle ups the ante with its dual-grid format. Hereâ€™s a quick comparison:  

- **Wordle**: Solve one 5-letter word in six attempts.  
- **Dordle**: Solve two 5-letter words in seven attempts.  

Both games use a grid-based structure and color-coded tiles to indicate correct letters and placements. However, Dordle demands a higher level of strategy, as each guess must work for both grids simultaneously.

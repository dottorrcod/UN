# Gate.io Exchange Review and Beginner's Guide

## Introduction to Gate.io Exchange

Gate.io, formerly known as Bter, was founded in 2013 and has a history of over a decade, making it older than OKX and Binance. Many crypto veterans are familiar with Bter as it was the platform where they made their first Bitcoin and Ethereum purchases.

Gate.io currently ranks 9th in spot trading and 11th in derivatives trading on CMC. It stands out as a solid choice for a trading platform due to its liquidity and security. One significant advantage is that Gate.io does not require a VPN for access, which makes it more user-friendly for beginners compared to OKX and Binance.

Another highlight is Gate.io's broad range of tradable tokens, with over 1,400 options. However, many of these are lesser-known altcoins, which come with high investment risks.

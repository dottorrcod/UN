## How Ankr (ANKR) Works

Ankr is among the most innovative blockchain companies, dedicated to advancing Web3 infrastructure. One of its core goals is achieving affordable decentralization without compromising security.

The protocol uses the computational power provided by distributed computing systems and **distributed ledger technology (DLT)** to enhance the efficiency of DApps, staking nodes, and its Web3 infrastructure. Collected data resources are distributed to network stakers and developers via data centers, facilitating the seamless creation and deployment of DApps at symbolic costs.

### Key Features of Ankr

- **Stkr Protocol:** Ankr introduced the **Stkr protocol**, enabling users to stake **ETH** with ease. In return, users receive aETH, representing their staked ETH balance and estimated rewards. This approach provides high liquidity for ETH 2.0 stakers.
- **Simplified Node Deployment:** Ankr streamlines node deployment for users, eliminating the need for extensive technical expertise. Participants can contribute as validator nodes or delegator nodes, depending on their preferences and technical skills.
- **Cross-Chain Staking:** The platform allows for cross-chain staking, making it easier for developers to deploy decentralized applications securely on Ankr's mainnet.

### Benefits for Developers and Users

Ankr enables developers to deploy decentralized applications efficiently while benefiting from robust cross-chain staking. Its simplified APIs ensure easy integration, while DApp developers enjoy enhanced security offered by the Ankr network.

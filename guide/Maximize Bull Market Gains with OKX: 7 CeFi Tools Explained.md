## Strategy Products

OKX offers a suite of **automated and customized trading tools** to enhance efficiency and reduce manual operations. These products cater to various market conditions and trading needs. Let's dive into some of the most popular strategies:

### Spot Grid Trading: Perfect for Volatile Markets

Spot grid trading involves **buying low and selling high** within a predefined price range, making it suitable for **sideways or moderately bullish markets**.

#### How It Works:
1. **Investment Amount**: The user allocates 2 BTC as the initial capital for the grid strategy. Some funds are used to buy BTC, while the rest is held in USDT.
2. **Strategy Execution**: As Bitcoin's price fluctuates between **$25,000 and $30,000**, the system automatically executes buy orders when prices fall below a certain level and sell orders when prices rise. For instance, if BTC drops to **$26,000**, the system buys BTC. If BTC rebounds to **$27,000**, the system sells BTC for profit.
3. **Adjustments**: Users can adjust the strategy or withdraw profits at any time.

#### Key Advantages:
- Spot grid trading captures **micro-volatility** for consistent gains.
- The system minimizes manual intervention, automatically executing trades within your parameters.
- Users can select pre-configured grids or customize their parameters for tailored performance.
